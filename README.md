# Magic-Platformer-Game
Personal Project made in early 2022, made in Unity Game Engine using Visual Studio Code, written in C#. Incorporates the Mirror plugin for multiplayer syncing across multiple clients.

The primary folder to view would be Assets -> Scripts, which is where the majority of my written code is for the project. The subfolder "Spells" deals with projectiles, and the folder "Lobby Nonsense" includes code for creating and joining user lobbies through the Steamworks API.
